# Assignment 8 - Corey Kwon
## The Data Science Toolbox

This is my submission for assignment 8 for the Data Science Toolbox.

According to the assignment instructions, I am able to "use any online material provided that you give appropriate attributions and credit to the original authors".

Therefore, I have taken materials online from a repository made by user prathameshtari.

The user used machine learning to predict football match outcomes. 

I do not take credit for any of prathameshtari's work. 

Here is a [link to their repository](https://github.com/prathameshtari/Predicting-Football-Match-Outcome-using-Machine-Learning).
